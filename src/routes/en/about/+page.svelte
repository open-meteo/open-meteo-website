			Open-Meteo is an open-source weather API and offers free access for non-commercial use. No API
			key is required. You can use it immediately!
		</p>
		<p>
			We at Open-Meteo believe that access to accurate and reliable weather data should be available
			to everyone. That's why we have created an open-source weather API that utilizes open-data
			weather forecasts provided by national weather services. These numerical weather predictions
			are free to download, but working with them can be challenging due to the expertise required
			in binary file formats, grid-systems, projections, and the fundamentals of weather
			predictions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our team has worked hard to create a user-friendly API that integrates high-resolution local
			and global weather models. Every day, over 2 TB of data are downloaded and processed from
			multiple national weather services. We then store the collected data in local files using a
			customized file format and compression technique to enhance access to time-series data such as
			a 14-day temperature forecast.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike other weather APIs, Open-Meteo provides complete access to its source code, and all
			data sources are openly listed, crediting the national weather services for their work. With
			Docker or prebuilt Ubuntu packages, users can launch their own weather API within minutes. By
			providing the source code, users can conduct detailed verifications of the weather data
			processing and even make modifications themselves. We welcome and encourage contributions from
			our users.
		</p>
		<p>
			The API is available for non-commercial use at no cost. Despite being free of charge, the
			forecast accuracy is top-notch. The API utilizes a vast array of local weather models with
			rapid updates, ensuring that the most precise forecast is generated for any location globally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for considering Open-Meteo for your weather data needs. We are always striving to
			improve and welcome any feedback or questions you may have. Please feel free to contact us at <a
