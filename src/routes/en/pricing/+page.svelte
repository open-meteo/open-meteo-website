				Open-Meteo brings together cutting-edge local (1 km resolution) and global (11 km) weather
				models sourced from renowned national weather services. This means you have access to the
				most accurate forecast for any location worldwide.
			</p>
			<p>
				National weather services include Deutscher Wetter Dienst (DWD), National Oceanic and
				Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Meteofrance and Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC).

				If you have any inquiries or require assistance, please feel free to reach out to us at <a
					href="mailto:info@open-meteo.com">info@open-meteo.com</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the evaluation, prototyping, and development stages, we encourage you to utilize the
				free tier. However, for your production system, we will provide you with an API key to
				ensure that your application reliably receives weather data.

				<h3 class="pl-3 text-2xl">Large API Call Volume</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				The API price includes millions of API calls, and you will not be billed for each individual
				API call. We suggest updating the weather forecast API every hour to achieve optimal
				accuracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you anticipate a higher volume of API calls, you have the option to adjust the quantity
				of the API professional plan, doubling or even tripling the number of monthly API calls.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you anticipate billions or more API calls, we recommend self-hosting the API. Feel free
				to reach out to us, and we will provide assistance and support for your self-hosting needs!

		<h2 id="faq" class="text-center text-5xl font-light">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

		<div class="mt-6 grid gap-x-2 gap-y-6 md:mt-12 md:grid-cols-2">
			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">How does the subscription process work?</h4>
				<p>
					To subscribe, you can sign up using a credit card by clicking on the subscription button
					above. Once you complete the subscription, you will immediately receive an API key and a
					PDF invoice. This API key allows you to access the dedicated API instances for customers.
					If you ever wish to cancel your subscription, you can do so at any time through the <a
						href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00gbIQ79OcpM9eEbII">customer portal</a
					>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">What happens if I exceed my monthly call volume?</h4>
				<p>
					If you approach 80%, 90%, or 100% of your monthly call volume, you will receive email
					notifications to keep you informed. However, due to the ample number of API calls
					provided, it is unlikely that you will reach this limit.
				</p>

				<Alert.Root variant="warning">
					<Alert.Description>
						ðŸš§ ðŸ‘· Please note that a web portal with API usage statistics is currently under
						development. Until it is available, you will not face any limitations on your usage.
					</Alert.Description>
				</Alert.Root>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">What sets apart the free API from the customer API?</h4>
				<p>
					The free API is accessible to everyone for non-commercial purposes and does not come with
					any service guarantees. On the other hand, the customer API is specifically designed for
					commercial use, offering dedicated API server instances to ensure sufficient resources and
					reliable API performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					To differentiate between the two, the customer API uses distinct domains such as <mark
						>customer-api.open-meteo.com</mark
					>
					and includes API keys in the URL, denoted as <mark>&apikey=abc123</mark>. Apart from these
					variations, the syntax of the customer API remains identical to the free API.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">
					Using the <mark>Standard API Plan</mark> can I use historical, climate and ensemble data?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Access to historical, climate, and ensemble data is limited to the <mark
						>Professional API Plan</mark
					>. If you are interested in utilizing this data, you can easily upgrade your subscription
					by visiting the
					<a href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00gbIQ79OcpM9eEbII">customer portal</a>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">How is one API call defined?</h4>
				<p>
					Typically, one API call corresponds to one HTTP API request. However, if you select 200
					weather variables simultaneously and make extensive use of the API, the number of API
					calls can increase. Therefore, API queries that involve more than 10 weather variables or
					more than 7 days of data are considered more than just one API call.
				</p>
				<p>
					To calculate the number of API calls accurately, fractional counts are used. For example,
					15 weather variables count as 1.5 API calls, while 4 weeks of weather data count as 3.0
					API calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					This distinction is crucial for developing future features such as APIs for multiple
					locations simultaneously.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">Is it necessary to provide attribution to Open-Meteo?</h4>
				<p>
					Open-Meteo relies on open data that is licensed under <a
						href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
