				If you anticipate a higher volume of API calls, you have the option to adjust the quantity
				of the API professional plan, doubling or even tripling the number of monthly API calls.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you anticipate billions or more API calls, we recommend self-hosting the API. Feel free

		<div class="mt-6 grid gap-x-2 gap-y-6 md:mt-12 md:grid-cols-2">
			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">How does the subscription process work?</h4>
				<p>
					To subscribe, you can sign up using a credit card by clicking on the subscription button
					above. Once you complete the subscription, you will immediately receive an API key and a
					PDF invoice. This API key allows you to access the dedicated API instances for customers.
					If you ever wish to cancel your subscription, you can do so at any time through the <a
						href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00gbIQ79OcpM9eEbII">customer portal</a
					>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">What happens if I exceed my monthly call volume?</h4>
				<p>
					If you approach 80%, 90%, or 100% of your monthly call volume, you will receive email
					notifications to keep you informed. However, due to the ample number of API calls
					provided, it is unlikely that you will reach this limit.
				</p>

				<Alert.Root variant="warning">
					<Alert.Description>
						ðŸš§ ðŸ‘· Please note that a web portal with API usage statistics is currently under
						development. Until it is available, you will not face any limitations on your usage.
					</Alert.Description>
				</Alert.Root>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">What sets apart the free API from the customer API?</h4>
				<p>
					The free API is accessible to everyone for non-commercial purposes and does not come with
					any service guarantees. On the other hand, the customer API is specifically designed for
					commercial use, offering dedicated API server instances to ensure sufficient resources and
					reliable API performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					To differentiate between the two, the customer API uses distinct domains such as <mark
						>customer-api.open-meteo.com</mark
					>
					and includes API keys in the URL, denoted as <mark>&apikey=abc123</mark>. Apart from these
					variations, the syntax of the customer API remains identical to the free API.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">
					Using the <mark>Standard API Plan</mark> can I use historical, climate and ensemble data?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Access to historical, climate, and ensemble data is limited to the <mark
						>Professional API Plan</mark
					>. If you are interested in utilizing this data, you can easily upgrade your subscription
					by visiting the
					<a href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00gbIQ79OcpM9eEbII">customer portal</a>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">How is one API call defined?</h4>
				<p>
					Typically, one API call corresponds to one HTTP API request. However, if you select 200
					weather variables simultaneously and make extensive use of the API, the number of API
					calls can increase. Requests for data covering more than 10 weather variables or extending
					over a period of more than 2 weeks for a single location are considered multiple API
					calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					To calculate the number of API calls accurately, fractional counts are used. For example,
					a request for 2 weeks of data with 15 weather variables will be calculated as 1.5 API
					calls, while 4 weeks of data equals 3.0 API calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					This distinction is crucial for developing future features such as APIs for multiple
					locations simultaneously.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4 class="mb-3 text-2xl">Is it necessary to provide attribution to Open-Meteo?</h4>
				<p>
					Open-Meteo relies on open data that is licensed under <a
